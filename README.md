# Medical-Diagnosis-System

The Medical Diagnosis System is an innovative tool that harnesses machine learning algorithms to perform predictive analysis, identifying and diagnosing prevalent health conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. By providing accurate predictions based on patient data, this system empowers healthcare professionals and individuals to make informed health decisions.

The system incorporates three tailored machine learning models, each designed for a specific health condition:

1. Cancer Prediction: Utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm, which excels in managing datasets with independent variables to accurately assess cancer risk.

2. Diabetes Prediction: Implements Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques to effectively analyze complex, non-linear interactions in various patient data, allowing for precise categorization of diabetes risk.

3. Heart Disease Prediction: Employs Logistic Regression to evaluate critical health markers, estimating the risk of heart disease based on comprehensive patient profiles.

The system aggregates data from reputable sources and undergoes meticulous preprocessing steps. This includes data cleaning, addressing missing values, and encoding categorical data, all aimed at ensuring the highest accuracy in predictions.

Developed using Streamlit, the application features a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to input their health data effortlessly. Users receive real-time predictions, making the system accessible and practical for everyday use.

The models are serialized for swift loading and seamless integration within the Streamlit application. Deployed on Streamlit's cloud service, the app guarantees easy access for users around the globe, facilitating widespread utilization of its predictive capabilities.

Through its sophisticated approach, the Medical Diagnosis System not only enhances diagnostic accuracy but also contributes to improved health outcomes by fostering proactive health management.
